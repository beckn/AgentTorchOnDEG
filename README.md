# AgentTorchOnDEG

AgentTorchOnDEG is an experimental platform for simulating energy transactions on a digital electricity grid. The goal of the project is to showcase how Beckn Protocol based APIs can support open and interoperable energy services.

## Description

The repository provides workflow guides and sample message sequences for common electricity use cases such as connection requests, peer-to-peer trading, solar installation and battery rental. These guides illustrate how different participants interact in a decentralized marketplace. The codebase will gradually include simulation tools to model these interactions on a small scale grid.

## Features

- Simulated peer-to-peer energy trading
- Connection service onboarding flows
- Solar panel installation and battery storage rental workflows
- Demand flexibility and subsidy examples
- Reference BAP/BPP message sequences using the Beckn Protocol
- Placeholder modules for advanced grid simulations

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AgentTorchOnDEG.git
cd AgentTorchOnDEG

# Install dependencies
# (To be added)
```

## Usage

Consult the guides under `docs/implementation_guides/beckn_workflows` for a step-by-step description of the sample workflows. Simulation scripts will be added over time.
